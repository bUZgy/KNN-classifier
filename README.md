# KNN-classifier

 Consider the three-dimensional data set in train.csv. 
 
(1)  Classify the data points in test.csv according to their 3-nearest neighbors. Also give the 
probability estimates for the final decision. 

(2)  Do the same for the Euclidean distance weighted 3-nearest neighbors (1/ùëë2). Doe the predicted 
label for each point remain the same as that in question (1)? 

(3)  In the test.csv, the true class labels are also provided. Construct the confusion matrix and 
calculate Accuracy, Precision, F-measure for questions (1) and (2).
